      <h1>From District to Nationals: My IndiaSkills Cybersecurity Story</h1>
      <p class="blog-date">Published on July 2, 2024</p>

      <p>Every journey begins with a single step — and mine began at <strong>NIELIT Patna</strong>, where I first discovered the opportunity to participate in the <strong>IndiaSkills competition</strong>, a prestigious platform that brings together the best young talent across various vocational trades in India.</p>

      <h2>The Beginning: Online Round</h2>
      <p>I chose the <strong>Cybersecurity</strong> trade, a field I’ve always been passionate about. The initial round was conducted online and tested participants on soft skills, aptitude, and cybersecurity knowledge. When I cleared this round, it felt like my first big leap toward something greater.</p>

      <h2>The Track 2 Route: Going Beyond Limits</h2>
      <p>Since my state didn’t sponsor IndiaSkills candidates, I took the <strong>Track 2</strong> path, organized by <strong>SSC NASSCOM</strong>. This alternate route included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Round 1</strong>: An AI-proctored test covering system hardening, malware analysis, and competition safety.</li>
        <li><strong>Round 2</strong>: A 2-day competition at <strong>Ethnus, Bangalore</strong> featuring intense practical rounds in server hardening, vulnerability analysis, and log monitoring.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Nationals: Delhi</h2>
      <p>Being selected for the <strong>IndiaSkills Nationals in Delhi</strong> was a dream come true. It spanned five days, starting with a grand opening ceremony, followed by three days of long, demanding practicals in areas like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Linux & Windows Server hardening</li>
        <li>Apache & IIS configuration</li>
        <li>Splunk & SIEM operations</li>
        <li>Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Unfortunately, technical issues disrupted the first two days — including firewall problems and VM crashes. Despite those setbacks, I pushed through, even during the final 12-hour challenge.</p>

      <h2>Lessons Beyond the Scoreboard</h2>
      <p>Although I didn’t win a medal, the experience gave me much more: confidence, friendships, a certificate of participation, and a deeper understanding of real-world cybersecurity under pressure.</p>
      <p>This journey taught me that competitions aren’t just about winning — they’re about learning, adapting, and evolving. I’m grateful for the opportunity, and excited for what lies ahead.</p>

      <p><em>Thank you to NIELIT, SSC NASSCOM, and every peer who stood shoulder-to-shoulder with me on this incredible path.</em></p>
